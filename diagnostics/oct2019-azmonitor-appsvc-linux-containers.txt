Issues & Opportunities
1.	Logs are off by default for Linux
2.	App logs blade needs to link to actual logs
3.	special .net core 3 metrics should be exposed, also how to get my custom metrics
4.	colors are hard to contrast for metrics
5.	startup failures should have special case detector, metrics and errors for startup failures when every request results in failures
6.	startup failure, in functions, very painful and no context
7.	App Insights blade link broken in portal for Linux
8.	App service failed request logs and metrics have gaps over functions experience
