Diagnostics Experience Notes
App Service Linux Containers
.Net Core 3.0

https://aka.ms/diagexp1

1.	Logs are off by default
2.	have app logs link to actual logs
3.	special .net core 3 metrics to be exposed, my custom metrics
4.	colors are hard to contrast for metrics
5.	we should have metrics and errors for startup failures when every request results in failures
6.	startup failure, in functions, very painful and no context
7.	links are broken to app insights blade in portal for Linux
8.	app service failed request monitoring has gaps compared to functions
