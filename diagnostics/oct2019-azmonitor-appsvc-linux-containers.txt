Diagnostics Experience Notes
App Service Linux Containers
.Net Core 3.0

https://aka.ms/diagexp1

1. colors are hard to contrast for metrics
2. we should have metrics and errors for startup failures when every request results in failures
3. Logs are off by default
4. have app logs link to actual logs
5. links are broken to app insight in portal for Linux
6. share functions basic monitoring of requests back with app service
7. startup failure, in functions, very painful and no context
8. special .net core 3 metrics to be exposed, my custom metrics
